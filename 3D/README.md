# Warping tasks: 3D stack of 2D slices
This task will focus on calculating a 3D to 3D diffeomorphism between spatially coherent stack of slices (2D+z) or 3D volumes (3D) and a volumetric template (3D) within the warping ecosystem using intensity-based metric.

In the following, the rat target volume will be the [**Waxholm MRI rat template**](http://www.nitrc.org/projects/whs-sd-atlas), a 512x512x1024 volume of 39.06 um isotropic voxel resolution.

The mouse target volume will be the **Allen Brain Mouse STP template** a 512x512x1024 volume of 25 um isotropic voxel resolution.

## Dataset \#1.  Rat brain MRI/DTI volumes acquired with the same parameters as the Waxholm Space template
In this use case, a  

## Dataset \#2.  Waxholm Space mouse brain template (Johnson et al., Neuroimage 53:365-372, 2010) to mouse target

## Dataset \#3.  Serial two-photon tomography (STPT) volumes to rat

## Dataset \#4.  3-D histology reconstructions showing rat brain connectivity (RUP product 15-7)

## Dataset \#5.  Volumetric lightsheet microscopy data  (T1.3.1 / CDP1)
